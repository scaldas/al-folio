I'm a Ph.D. student in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-phd.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm broadly interested in building transfer learning systems that are useful in the real world. Currently, I'm focused on federated scenarios, particularly healthcare domains. I'm a member of the [AutonLab](https://www.autonlab.org/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/).
