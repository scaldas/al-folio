I'm a Ph.D. student in [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-phd.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm broadly interested in building intelligent systems that leverage useful knowledge from multiple sources (e.g., heterogeneous data owners). In particular, my research tackles practical constraints preventing these systems from working in a wider array of scenarios. Currently, I'm focused on healthcare domains using federated learning techniques. I'm a member of the [AutonLab](https://www.autonlab.org/), advised by [Prof. Artur Dubrawski](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/artur-w-dubrawski/).
